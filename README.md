# LATTICE: Large-scale Architectures with Transformers and Techniques for Integrated Comparative Evaluation

> A modular and extensible framework for designing, training, and evaluating Transformer-based LLM architectures with scientific rigor and experimental flexibility.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

LATTICE is a research-engineering project aimed at understanding and building modern Large Language Model (LLM) architectures from the ground up. It is designed to evolve over time while offering:

- 🔧 A structured foundation to **implement LLM components** such as attention variants, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and RLHF pipelines
- 📊 A robust experimental setup to **evaluate models using standard and advanced metrics**
- 🧪 A modular infrastructure for **comparing, visualizing, and benchmarking** novel architectural techniques
- 🔄 A flexible environment for **scaling and evolving** LLM designs through version control and modularity

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Learn and build modern Transformer-based architectures at the component level
- ✅ Compare and analyze different attention mechanisms and routing strategies
- ✅ Integrate MoE layers and evaluate their efficiency (latency, memory, routing entropy)
- ✅ Construct and test Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines
- ✅ Develop a full training and evaluation pipeline with experiment tracking
- ✅ Maintain reproducibility and clarity via config management and experiment versioning (Hydra + MLflow)
- ✅ Support model evolution through modularity and milestone-based development
- ✅ Align with global open-source LLM practices and architecture design patterns
- ✅ Provide a structured showcase of LLM architectural engineering capabilities
